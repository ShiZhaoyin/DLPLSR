# DLPLSR: Dual-Label Propagation Least Squares Regression for Semi-Supervised Classification

This repository provides the official MATLAB implementation of **DLPLSR**, a dual-label propagationâ€“based least squares regression framework for semi-supervised classification.  
DLPLSR jointly exploits local manifold information and global clustering structure without generating explicit pseudo-labels, and employs an orthogonal-sparse projection to select compact and discriminative features.
